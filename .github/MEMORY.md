## Bug Fix: Low Usage Mode Stats Display Issue (v7.3.10)

**Date:** 2025-05-25  
**Issue:** When low usage mode is enabled, stats on the home page sometimes display incorrect numbers (showing old/cached values instead of current stats).  
**Root Cause:** Low usage mode's `disableIntensiveRendering()` function throttles `requestAnimationFrame` to only allow calls every 500ms, returning `null` for most calls. The `animateNumber()` function in `updateStatsDisplay()` relies on `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth number animations, but when throttled, the animations don't complete properly, leaving stats displaying incorrect values. Additionally, there was a race condition between stats loading and low usage mode detection.

**Solution:** 
1. **v7.4.0:** Modified `updateStatsDisplay()` function to detect when low usage mode is enabled and bypass animations entirely.
2. **v7.4.1:** Fixed race condition by ensuring low usage mode is checked before stats are loaded, and added robust multi-source detection for low usage mode state.

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/static/js/new-main.js` - Added low usage mode detection, fixed initialization order, and improved state detection

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// v7.4.0: Basic low usage mode detection
const isLowUsageMode = document.body.classList.contains('low-usage-mode');

// v7.4.1: Robust multi-source detection
isLowUsageModeEnabled: function() {
    const hasLowUsageClass = document.body.classList.contains('low-usage-mode');
    const standaloneModuleEnabled = window.LowUsageMode && window.LowUsageMode.isEnabled && window.LowUsageMode.isEnabled();
    const indicator = document.getElementById('low-usage-mode-indicator');
    const indicatorVisible = indicator && indicator.style.display !== 'none' && indicator.style.display !== '';
    return hasLowUsageClass || standaloneModuleEnabled || indicatorVisible;
}

// Fixed initialization order to check low usage mode before loading stats
this.checkLowUsageMode().then(() => {
    if (window.location.pathname === '/') {
        this.loadMediaStats();
    }
})
```

**Testing:** Verified that stats display correctly both with low usage mode enabled (direct values) and disabled (animated values), and that the race condition is resolved.

## UI Improvement: Countdown Timer Startup Messaging (v7.3.10)

**Date:** 2025-05-25  
**Issue:** When Docker container starts/restarts, countdown timers show "Error Loading" initially, which is confusing to users since it's not actually an error - the timer is just waiting for the first app cycle to complete so it can calculate the next cycle time.  
**Root Cause:** The `displayLoadError()` function in `cycle-countdown.js` was showing "Error Loading" whenever the sleep.json file wasn't available, which happens normally during startup before the first cycle completes.

**Solution:** 
1. Renamed `displayLoadError()` to `displayWaitingForCycle()` for clarity
2. Changed the message from "Error Loading" to "Waiting for Cycle" 
3. Applied the same light blue color (#00c2ce) and refreshing-state class as used for normal refreshing
4. Updated comments and error handling to distinguish between startup waiting vs actual errors
5. Improved `updateTimerError()` to show proper error styling for actual connection issues

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/static/js/cycle-countdown.js` - Improved startup messaging and error handling

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Confusing error message during normal startup
timerValue.textContent = 'Error Loading';
timerValue.classList.add('error');

// After: Clear waiting message with proper styling
timerValue.textContent = 'Waiting for Cycle';
timerValue.classList.add('refreshing-state');
timerValue.style.color = '#00c2ce'; // Light blue like refreshing state
```

**User Experience:** Users now see "Waiting for Cycle" in light blue during startup instead of the alarming "Error Loading" message, making it clear that the system is working normally and just waiting for the first cycle to complete.

## UI Improvement: Countdown Timer Reset Behavior (v7.3.10)

**Date:** 2025-05-25  
**Issue:** When pressing the reset button on countdown timers, "Refreshing" message only stays for about 1 second then disappears, which is misleading because the actual reset process takes much longer (the app needs to complete a full cycle before new timer data is available).  
**Root Cause:** The reset button logic was using a simple 2-second timeout before fetching new data, but the actual reset process can take several minutes depending on the app's cycle duration.

**Solution:** 
1. Implemented intelligent polling system that keeps "Refreshing" displayed until actual new timer data is available
2. Added `data-waiting-for-reset` attribute to track timers waiting for reset data
3. Modified `updateTimerDisplay()` to respect the waiting state and not override "Refreshing" message
4. Added `startResetPolling()` function that polls every 5 seconds for up to 5 minutes
5. **CRITICAL FIX**: Store original cycle time before reset and only consider reset complete when receiving a *different* cycle time
6. Only removes "Refreshing" when genuinely new countdown data is received (not just the same old data)

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/static/js/cycle-countdown.js` - Improved reset button behavior and polling logic
- `.github/listen.MD` - Added guidance to not update version numbers automatically

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Simple timeout that was misleading
setTimeout(() => {
    fetchFromSleepJson();
}, 2000);

// After: Intelligent polling that waits for genuinely new data
function startResetPolling(app) {
    const pollInterval = setInterval(() => {
        fetchFromSleepJson().then(() => {
            if (nextCycleTimes[app]) {
                const currentCycleTime = nextCycleTimes[app].getTime();
                const originalCycleTime = parseInt(timerElement.getAttribute('data-original-cycle-time'));
                
                // Only consider reset complete if we have a DIFFERENT cycle time
                if (originalCycleTime === null || currentCycleTime !== originalCycleTime) {
                    // Genuinely new data received, stop polling and update display
                    timerElement.removeAttribute('data-waiting-for-reset');
                    clearInterval(pollInterval);
                    updateTimerDisplay(app);
                } else {
                    // Same old data, keep polling
                    console.log('Same cycle time, continuing to poll for new data');
                }
            }
        });
    }, 5000); // Poll every 5 seconds
}
```

**User Experience:** Users now see "Refreshing" for the appropriate duration until the reset process actually completes and new countdown data is available, providing accurate feedback about the system state.

## Bug Fix: Sonarr Season Packs API Limit Tracking Issue (v7.3.10)

**Date:** 2025-05-25  
**Issue:** When using Season Packs mode in Sonarr, API limit tracking was inaccurate. The system was double-counting API calls - once for the `search_season()` API call and again for each episode's stats increment, causing the hourly API cap to be exceeded much faster than it should be.  
**Root Cause:** 
1. `search_season()` function in `api.py` was not tracking its API call in the hourly cap counter
2. Season pack processing in `missing.py` and `upgrade.py` was using `increment_stat()` which automatically increments both stats AND API cap counter for each episode
3. This resulted in: 1 actual API call + N episode stat increments = 1 + N API cap increments (should only be 1)

**Example:** A season with 10 episodes would count as 11 API calls instead of 1, causing users to hit their hourly limit 11x faster.

**Solution:** 
1. **Fixed `search_season()` function** - Added proper API call tracking using `increment_hourly_cap()`
2. **Created new `increment_stat_only()` function** - Increments stats without touching API cap counter
3. **Updated season pack logic** - Changed from `increment_stat()` to `increment_stat_only()` in both missing and upgrade season modes

**Files Modified:**
- `src/primary/apps/sonarr/api.py` - Added API call tracking to `search_season()` function
- `src/primary/stats_manager.py` - Added `increment_stat_only()` function for season packs
- `src/primary/apps/sonarr/missing.py` - Updated season pack stats to use `increment_stat_only()`
- `src/primary/apps/sonarr/upgrade.py` - Updated season pack stats to use `increment_stat_only()`

**Code Changes:**
```python
# In api.py - Added API tracking to search_season()
def search_season(api_url, api_key, api_timeout, series_id, season_number):
    # ... existing API call logic ...
    
    # CRITICAL FIX: Track the API call in hourly cap counter
    try:
        from src.primary.stats_manager import increment_hourly_cap
        increment_hourly_cap("sonarr", 1)
    except Exception as cap_error:
        logger.error(f"Failed to increment hourly API cap: {cap_error}")

# In stats_manager.py - New function for season packs
def increment_stat_only(app_type, stat_type, count=1):
    """Increment stats WITHOUT incrementing API cap counter"""
    # CRITICAL: Do NOT increment hourly API cap - for season packs where
    # the API call is already tracked separately in search_season()
    
# In missing.py and upgrade.py - Updated season pack logic
# Before: Double-counted API calls
for i in range(episode_count):
    increment_stat("sonarr", "hunted")  # This increments BOTH stats AND API cap

# After: Accurate API tracking
for i in range(episode_count):
    increment_stat_only("sonarr", "hunted")  # Only increments stats
```

**Impact:** This fix ensures that season pack searches are accurately tracked as 1 API call regardless of how many episodes are in the season, preventing premature API limit exhaustion.

**Testing:** Verified that container starts successfully and Sonarr is running in seasons_packs mode where the fix applies.

## Bug Fix: History Page Tooltip Obscured After Page Refresh (v7.3.10)

**Date:** 2025-05-25  
**Issue:** JSON popup tooltips in the History page get obscured by other menu items after a page refresh/reload. The tooltip displays correctly initially but becomes hidden behind other elements after refreshing the page.  
**Root Cause:** The tooltip was using `position: absolute` and being appended as a child of the info icon, which created stacking context issues. After page refresh, the z-index wasn't being properly enforced, causing the tooltip to appear behind other page elements.

**Solution:** 
1. **Changed positioning approach** - Switched from `position: absolute` to `position: fixed` to escape stacking context issues
2. **Moved tooltip to document body** - Instead of appending to the icon, append to `document.body` for proper positioning
3. **Simplified CSS** - Removed complex background layers and animations that were causing conflicts
4. **Enhanced JavaScript positioning** - Added proper viewport boundary detection and positioning logic
5. **Removed CSS hover rules** - Handled all tooltip display logic through JavaScript for better control

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/static/js/history.js` - Fixed tooltip positioning and event handling
- `frontend/templates/components/history_section.html` - Simplified tooltip CSS

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Tooltip appended to icon with absolute positioning
infoIcon.appendChild(tooltip);
tooltip.style.position = 'absolute';

// After: Tooltip appended to body with fixed positioning
document.body.appendChild(tooltip);
tooltip.style.position = 'fixed';

// Enhanced positioning logic
infoIcon.addEventListener('mouseenter', (e) => {
    const iconRect = infoIcon.getBoundingClientRect();
    
    // Position tooltip near the icon using fixed positioning
    tooltip.style.left = (iconRect.right + 10) + 'px';
    tooltip.style.top = iconRect.top + 'px';
    
    // Adjust if tooltip would go off screen
    const tooltipWidth = 350;
    if (iconRect.right + tooltipWidth + 10 > window.innerWidth) {
        tooltip.style.left = (iconRect.left - tooltipWidth - 10) + 'px';
    }
    
    // Adjust if tooltip would go off bottom of screen
    const tooltipHeight = 300;
    if (iconRect.top + tooltipHeight > window.innerHeight) {
        tooltip.style.top = (window.innerHeight - tooltipHeight - 10) + 'px';
    }
    
    tooltip.style.display = 'block';
});
```

**CSS Changes:**
```css
/* Before: Complex positioning with multiple layers */
.json-tooltip {
    position: absolute !important;
    /* Complex background layers and animations */
}

/* After: Simple fixed positioning */
.json-tooltip {
    display: none;
    position: fixed; /* Use fixed positioning to escape stacking context issues */
    z-index: 999999; /* Very high z-index */
    pointer-events: none; /* Prevent tooltip from interfering with mouse events */
}
```

**Impact:** Tooltips now display correctly both on initial page load and after page refresh, with proper positioning that respects viewport boundaries.

**Testing:** Verified that container starts successfully and tooltips work properly in all scenarios.
